# Installation


## Stable release

To install Stratified Clustering, run this command in your terminal:

```batch

    $ pip install stratified_clustering
```

This is the preferred method to install Stratified Clustering, as it will always
install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this 
[Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) 
can guide you through the process.
